# JK Furniture web page design

This web page was built for a project for a pre-apprentenship program with dev/mission. I choose a furniture website for
displaying products and acquiring information about the company

## ← `index.html`:

#### Firstly

- I set the document type to HTML 5, it's the standard right now
- I set english has the default language
  The Head (metadata)
- I set the charcter encoding To UTF-8, it's also the curreent standard
- name =viewport, allows your webpage to be responsive on differnet designs
- rel =icon, browser tab icon
- Attached a bootstrap link for css framework which is hosted on a content delivery network
  Bootstrap has to be the first link cause it take priority, so your stylesheet dosen't overide it
  You can use important! on your css to override bootstrap css
  You can also store bootstrap locally on you computer if you need offline access, instead of using the CDN
- I have my title line
- Then i have links to my js file and stylesheet css.
  js helps web page becaome more interactive
  css help with the color, borders, height and so much more

#### Secondly

We have our Body(main part of the HTML file )
As far as i know most webpage start with a NavBar and for conveience sake i just used a bootstrap Nav Bar
nav - is just HTML semantics for navigation (prioritize accesibilty for users, what content are they going to be navigation to)
class - (are used to group elements that you want to apply same characteristics to)
  In the nav we have class navbar navbar-expang-lg bg-body-tetiary
  navbar is just bootstrap default styling 
  -expang-lg helps with responsiveness on differnet devices 
  - body-tetiary - is the colour 
div - lets us group elements and we can apply specific styling or such. Think of it like a container
